  @details Display manager interfaces are version tagged to maintain backward compatibility. This
  version is supplied as a default argument during display core initialization.

  Client may use an older version of interfaces and link to a higher version of display manager
  library, but vice versa is not allowed.

  A 32-bit client must use 32-bit display core library and a 64-bit client must use 64-bit display
  core library.

  Display manager interfaces follow default data structures alignment. Client must not override the
  default padding rules while using these interfaces.

  @warning It is assumed that client upgrades or downgrades display core interface all at once
  and recompile all binaries which use these interfaces. Mix and match of these interfaces can
  lead to unpredictable behaviour.
