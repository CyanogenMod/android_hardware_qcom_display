 * To turn on layer dump for primary, do,

 *
 * To turn on layer dump for external, do,

 *
 * For example, to dump 25 frames in raw format, do,
 *     adb shell setprop debug.sf.dump 25
 * Layers are dumped in a time-stamped location: /data/sfdump*.
 *
 * To dump 10 frames in png format, do,

 * To dump another 25 or so frames in raw format, do,

 * To turn off logcat logging of layer-info, set both properties to 0,
